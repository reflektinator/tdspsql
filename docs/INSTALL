Under Debian you need at least:
 build-essential
 bison
 flex
 libicu-dev
 libgmp-dev

"make" from the root directory should build tdspsql.so. Copy this somewhere useful (or leave it there if you want)

update postgresql.conf to include the line:
shared_preload_libraries = '"/path/to/tdspsql.so"'

Restart postgres

Create a new database mssqlserver (this is the name of the default MSSQL instance. Other instances are not supported at this time)

Create a new user sa with full access into the mssqlserver database

Open SQL Server Management Studio and create a new SQL Query and connect to the IP address of your postgres server (Object Explorer won't work - too many internal dependencies). Run some queries.

Ironically, this doesn't actually work with tsql from freetds, probably due to some assumptions about protocol versions. This will be fixed at some point as tsql will be a good way to do regression testing.
